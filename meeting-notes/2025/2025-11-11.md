## Notes

- Recent confusing contributions
  - https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4424
- strict build issues
  - https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/4428
  - Is it rate limiting? Maybe
  - Is it zenodo just having a bad time? Maybe
  - https://theturingway.slack.com/archives/C01EUGMQSNP/p1762422635904599
- Do we want to be using Jupyter Book or myst directly?
  - Maybe in the future there'll be a new version of Jupyter Book whenever there's a new version of mystmd
  - Watch and wait for now
  - Might be political
  - Does the release delay matter to us?
  - Depends how multi-language is supported
- We seem to be back in the situation where all-contributors bot PRs don't trigger CI, but need CI to have passed to be merged
  - https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/4449
  - AP Sarah: tweak CI so that it returns as passed for allcontrib PRs, and comments on the issue saying it has done so (so that it is not silently approving)
- Tracking discussions
  - Sarah proposal: use draft cards on the board to track discussions we want to keep track of
  - Proposal supported
- Do we want to switch back to zoom?
  - jitsi seems to be working well enough (but not always perfect)
  - Danny preference for jitsi (works better on old tech and on mobile)
  - Jim preference for zoom (audio issues with Jitis), also points out zoom maybe better for accissibility
  - Conlusion: stay with jitsi for now, keep an eye on it
