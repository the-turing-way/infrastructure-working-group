## Notes

- Project board walkthrough
  - Blocked:
    - Waiting on some upstream Jupyter Book/myst things for missing alt text, bibliographies, etc
    - Waiting on upstream for --link-check to be made optional for --strict builds
      - Should try to cache link-checking in Workflows so CI doesn't time out (but still only run this weekly)
    -
- Portuguese language deployment
  - Moving `/website` to `/en` - do this now? How much interference with open PRs? Do a local check for clean merges - if that works, leave the change in, if not: revert for now
  - Make is possibly becoming limiting. There isn't a great way in Make to parametrise builds over languages
    - For now this isn't a huge problem
    - For *many* languages it would be a pain
    - Long term we may want to find an alternative (SnakeMake?) or write a small script to build the book for a given set of languages, or all languages at once.
