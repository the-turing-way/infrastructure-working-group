## Notes

- Things to talk about?
  - Pattern matching for ignoring links: https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/2334
    - Testing: ignores as in doesn't test, or ignores the result?
    - Possibly the second, but it'll pass CI
    - Problem is that if we try to test all the links in CI, it'll grind to a halt because there are so many
    - CI spins up 3 version, and then Netlify spins up a build too, and we get hammered for checking links on all of them
      - Possibly a problem with link checking library (time out period or number of retries)
  - CI tangents
    - Build matrix
      - For strict build, we can probably accept strict build on only one of the targets
      - Possible for strict build to fail on one and not another, but feels unlikely, not worth extending the test matrix
    - Link check inefficiency
      - CI workflow does builds on Linux, Windows, Mac in parallel
      - Then, link check (which involves another build)
      - Should keep the build output from one of these as an artifact to use in the link check step!
    - Build matrix 2
      - Do we need to build on all three OSs for every PR?
      - Usually a failure on one is a failure on all three
      - However, if we don't test each PR, when we do find a failure on another OS, doing the bisect becomes a huge chore (including installing windows)
  - Danny would like to attend the next Book Dash if possible and work on getting another language published
  - MySTMD and JB2
    - Some fixes in myst that we care about (GH edit link, keys for link check)
    - As we use `jupyter-book`, we need to wait for a release of `jupyter-book` with bumped `mystmd` version to take advantage of these
    - Given JB2 and mystmd are so similar, should be just stick closer to upstream and use mystmd
