    - Set up automatic redirects
- [PR triage bot](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4340)
  - We are likely to be happy with this if there is a need
  - Not quite clear what the application here
  - Should go back to Arielle to understand what we think the benefit might be
- JupyterCon workshop
  - The Turing Way needs to put a substantial effort into building the workshop
  - There was a [previous workshop](https://malvikasharan.github.io/jupyter-book-with-the-turing-way/index.html) which we can likely adapt/update for MyST+JB2
