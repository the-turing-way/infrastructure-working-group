Notes:

- Netlify now supports more modern Python
    - Updated Python and dependencies
- Tested deploying to GH page
    - No problems found
    - We prefer the workflow here:
        - Build HTML
        - Deploy HTML
        - Easier to reproduce the deployed build, likely less hassle in moving providers
- JupyterBook 2 release coming soon
    - Should keep our eyes on this
    - Test building when it is available (can we get beta versions?)
    - Unsure how many breaking changes will be introduced
- Ways of work
    - We would like to formalise this a bit
        - Clearer idea of what we should be working on
        - Better visibility
        - More efficient use of our limited time
    - "Standup"
        - Use the first(?) part of this meeting to do a review of the board
        - Template
            - What did you do
            - What will you do next
            - What are you blocked on
            - What did you learn
        - Could use a Slack bot for async stand up
    - Sprint planning
        - Choose which issues to move from ready to start to in progress
        - Check priorities
        - Tidy board
    - Could alternate meetings between planning and standup?
        - How much time do we have available
        - With the pace of work we have, how many meetings is too much?
    - Project board
        - Items with the "infrastructure" label are added automatically
        - Columns
            - Backlog (?) Can just become a unmanagable dump for issues that will never be addressed
            - Needs refinement (instead of backlog) issues that need some scoping before work can start
            - Refined issues ready to be picked up
            - Current/priority/... These are the issues we are doing now. They are possible and prioritised
            - Done
    - Responsibility
        - What does assignment in GH mean?
            - You are responsible for doing this?
            - You are responsible for ensuring this gets done? (_I.e._ you can delegate this)
        - Given the size of the team, we don't have a lot of scope for delegating work
    - Other benefits
        - Clear priorities
        - Better idea of what we could do with more contributors
        - Ready to propose GSoC and Outreachy
- Action
    - Use Co-working and collab cafe next week to write up the ways of work, reshape the board and do an initial triage
