Notes:
- Domain migration: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3266
    - risks that everyone is aware of the process
    - It has been mentioned on the newsletter and Slack Announcements
    - Changes that might be coming
- 2i2c and JupyterBook Opportunities to contribute back
    - Pathways: 
      - Potential to use Hugo-style taxonomies, tags
      - Tagged pages could be collected a views generated showing them + a table of contents
      - Pathways _also_ have order though, not just a collection of pages
      - Building this on Sphinx could be a bad idea as JupyterBook is moving to MystMD
    - JupyterBook is looking to move to build on Myst rather than Sphinx
      - Projects using uncommon/non-standard Sphinx extensions might have problems.
      - BS: feel free to use any of the tutorials I maintain to use for bug huntings, too.: numpy-tutorials, navo-workshop, astroml-notebook, etc. (or maybe just use numpy, and we propagate any stuff from there)
      - MystMD notes
        - JS (Typescript) based
        - Produces structured representation of document which enables tools to better understand documents
            - Rabbit-hole references
        - AST can be rendered by (for example) React
        - Focus on scientific documents - support for DOIs _etc._ in the core
        - Hopefully more flexible (easier to add functionality) than Sphinx
      - Impact on The Turing Way
        - Requires NodeJS
        - Produces pages dynamically (although there will are builders for "static" sites)
          - ReadTheDocs would be targeted specifically
          - [example static site](https://2i2c.org/report-czi-2021/)
          - Dynamic rendering would enable more interactive things
        - Should be backwards compatible, but dependencies will change
      - Could migrate to MyST now, requiring some markup changes
      - Angus is keen to have case studies, working with stakeholders to migrate to JupyterBook2
- PDF of the book 
    - MyST can use Typst or LaTeX (e.g. tectonic) to build PDFs (https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-pdf-documents)
- Book Dash: reminder to apply till the 27 April   
- 23 April Turing Way Forum: 5 min slidedeck
- Try [MyST sandbox](https://mystmd.org/sandbox) to see e.g. the AST and how the document is interpreted
    - Please do give it a try; we're quick on bug fixes! (Angus) :tada:
- Migrations from Netlify: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509
  - We should make a considered decision about where to host
    - RTD
    - GH pages
    - Cloud storage (bucket, _etc_)
    - Container service + NGINX (or similar)
    - Static site service (cloud provider)
- Add painpoints and strengths for each of them
- Premature to share with the wider community. Infrastructure WG working on it to give an informed recommendation (it's not urgent but something we need to do, review the best option)
