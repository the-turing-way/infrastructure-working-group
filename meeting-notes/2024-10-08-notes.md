Attendees:
- Jim
- Danny

Notes:

- Ask to make a slide for the next community forum
    - 18th October (some confusion about the date)
    - Someone needs to add some items to the slides and present
- Bookdash
    - Jim is hoping to use the bookdash to do some spring cleaning
    - Top item is splitting the repository down into smaller repositories
    - [Issue on this](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3352#issuecomment-1896470970)
- Chair position:
    - Jim is now chair
- Myst
    - Not heard from the MystMD team for a while
    - Trust they are working on MystMD and The Turing Way is still a target for testing
    - Difficult with small amounts of volunteer time to focus on connecting with them or helping
    - Perhaps could prioritise this
- Hosting migration
    - This work has stalled, waiting on translation
    - Might be worth migrating what we have now, to get away from Netlify and address translation support when we have bandwidth
    - Don't want to let work on translation support become a blocker?
    - Options
        - RTD (some problems shared Netlify - repo gets pulled and built by a runner we don't understand/control. Build is not reproducible local/remote)
        - GH pages (Can have the same build in CI/deployed/locally)
            - Loose automatic build previews!
            - [Pages PR preview action](https://github.com/rossjrw/pr-preview-action) [doese't work on PRs from forks](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7730#discussioncomment-1885967) :sob:
        - Some other html hosting
   - Action: Test run for GH Pages (on fork) 
   - Then: If that works, check if there are any objections
