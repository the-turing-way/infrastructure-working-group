Notes
- Deploying various languages in the book (Batool and Richie updated the group about the translation and localisation team)
- SG: her goal for the book dash is to look into the deployment to run the languages locally - run away of netlify. 
    - having our own domain
    - running away of netlify
    - being as ready as possible so when we get the flix to move we will be able to be multilingual
- Batool: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
    - Level/amount of translation in different chapters
    - https://turingway-arabic.netlify.app/
- Richie: duplicated the English version to other languages versions, do the switches using prefixes
- SG: Thought to discuss: a ‘default’ 404 page that says “this page is available in these languages, if not your desired one”
    - Another thought: a dropdown menu of languages instead of manipulating URLs
    - All we need to do is align and deep dive sphinx-intl extension, what problems it iterate and 
    - Rules of Yaml, linked it to style guide. Introduce a Yaml checker 
- Jim: Not sure if things like prettier and pre-commit are helpful if you find yaml/indenting confusing or if they just add to the confusion.
    - Balance between how to move on, is it a new book and what will be available in different languages
    - Breakdown the book into different repositories as we have an independent organisation
        - SG: 2i2 has a guideline not to extract 

Actions:
- Richie will share all the links of where he has been working 
- Jim will open up an issue on Githut about openning up different repos
- Sarah will represent the Infrastructure working group on the meeting on Friday 17 November
