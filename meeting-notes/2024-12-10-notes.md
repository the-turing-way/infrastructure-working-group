Notes:

- DISCUSSED: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3651
    - DECISION: close the PR, but we are interested in maintaining yaml check for TOC file, particularly if it can autocorrect in PRs
    - ACTION: Compare yamllint, vs check-yaml (precommit) vs prettier (precommit)
- DISCUSSED: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/2106
    - DECISION: Small number of conflicting files, probably worth investing _no more than_ 30 minutes into addressing comments and trying to merge. Should close if requires more than 30 mins.
    - ACTION: Assigned to Jim.
- DISCUSSED: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/1055
    - ACTION: Compare the python script with `all-contributors check` to see if the same work is happening or if it's different, make a decision to EITHER merge the PR OR close it and document using the all-contributors CLI instead
    - ACTION: Make upstream feature request to all-contributors that `check` function also returns commit title context to help users know _what_ to acknowledge contributors for
- DISCUSSED: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3958
    - ACTION: Ensure Windows bug is documented upstream for Jupyter Book for them
    - ACTION: Close the PR and reopen using an OS that is not Windows :D (SG to take this on) https://next.jupyterbook.org/upgrade
- DISCUSSED: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/2311
    - ACTION: See if this is still an issue in Jupyter Book 2 (see previous point)
